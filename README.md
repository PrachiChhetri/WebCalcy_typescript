TypeScript is a strict superset of JavaScript, which means anything that is implemented in JavaScript can be implemented using TypeScript along with the choice of adding enhanced features. It is an Open Source Object Oriented programming language and strongly typed language. As TS code is converted to JS code it makes it easier to integrate into JavaScript projects.
